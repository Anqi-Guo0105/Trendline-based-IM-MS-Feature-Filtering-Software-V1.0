The CCS of compound ions with similar structure changes regularly with m/z. Exploring the m/z-CCS distribution trend line by regression model fitting, and constructing IM-MS feature screening window combined with regression predictive analysis can significantly narrow the chemical search space for IM-MS experimental data analysis of complex samples, which is conducive to rapid screening and identification of chemical structural analogues in complex systems. “Trendline-based-IM-MS-Feature-Filtering-Software-V1.0” is written in Python and is publicly available for non-commercial use. In "Software" folder, the application software (exe file) is provided(https://github.com/Anqi-Guo0105/Trendline-based-IM-MS-Feature-Filtering-Software-V1.0/tree/main/Software). For detailed instructions, please refer to the user manual.

## Software

This software was developed to study the ion distribution trend of specific structural types of compounds in IM-MS analysis, realizing rapid and automatic screening of chemical structural analogues in complex systems based on IM-MS analysis, and improving the efficiency of IM-MS data analysis and compound identification.
